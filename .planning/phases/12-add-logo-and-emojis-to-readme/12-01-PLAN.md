<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add logo to README</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Add logo.png image near the top of README.md using markdown image syntax. Position after the main title and before the main introduction paragraph. Use alt text "Scenka logo" for accessibility. File path: ./logo.png (relative to README.md location).</action>
  <verify>README.md contains image markdown syntax: ![Scenka logo](./logo.png)</verify>
  <done>Logo appears at top of README with proper alt text</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add tasteful emojis to README</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Add strategic emojis throughout README to enhance visual appeal without going overboard. Target locations:
- Section headers (## What Makes Scenka Different, ## Tech Stack, ## Quick Start, etc.)
- Key feature bullets under "What Makes Scenka Different"
- Feature items in tech stack list
- Use sparingly - 1-2 strategic emojis per section max
- Choose emojis that fit climbing/theme: 🧗 (climbing), 📊 (analytics), ⚙️ (settings), 📱 (mobile), 🔒 (privacy), 🏔️ (PWA), ⚡ (offline), ✨ (features)

Principle: "Not overboard" means avoid decorating every bullet point or header. Use emojis as visual accents, not as the main content.</action>
  <verify>README.md contains emojis in multiple sections without excessive density (check visual balance)</verify>
  <done>Emojis added strategically to enhance sections without overwhelming the content</done>
</task>
