# Phase 17: Use the New Design System to Fix the Ugly Toggle - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The current toggle doesn't fit with the app's design - it looks ugly and out of place. We need to create a custom toggle component that matches our dark theme and spacing, designed specifically for Scenka rather than using generic toggle components.

The toggle should feel minimal and unobtrusive - it should blend into the background like it's always been there. No visual jarring, no calling attention to itself. Just natural UI that fits seamlessly with the rest of the app.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual consistency** - The toggle must not stand out or look ugly. It should look like it's always been part of the app's design system.

## Specific Ideas

- Custom toggle component (not using standard iOS or material design toggles)
- Matches the app's dark theme and spacing
- Minimal and unobtrusive - blends into the background
- Reference screenshots provided for current "ugly" toggle state

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

User has screenshots showing the current toggle state that needs fixing.

The toggle should follow the unified design system patterns established in Phase 14, using the same approach we took for SelectionButton, FormSection, and FormLabel components.
