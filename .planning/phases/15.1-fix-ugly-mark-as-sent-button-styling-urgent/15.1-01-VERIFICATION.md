# Phase 15.1: Fix Ugly Mark as Sent Button Styling Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Fix "Mark as Sent" button styling to conform to unified design system patterns by adding a proper ghost variant to the Button component
**Verified:** 2026-01-17T09:57:28Z
**Status:** passed

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| #   | Truth   | Status     | Evidence       |
| --- | ------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1   | Mark as Sent button uses consistent white opacity styling matching design system | ✓ VERIFIED | ghost variant in button.tsx line 17: `border-white/20 hover:border-white/40 bg-white/[0.02] text-[#888] hover:text-white` |
| 2   | Button background uses bg-white/[0.02] for minimal/inactive state | ✓ VERIFIED | Exact match found in ghost variant (button.tsx line 17) |
| 3   | Button border uses border-white/20 with hover:border-white/40 transition | ✓ VERIFIED | Exact match found in ghost variant (button.tsx line 17) |
| 4   | Button typography matches SelectionButton pattern (uppercase, font-black) | ✓ VERIFIED | ClimbCard line 212: `className="text-xs font-black uppercase tracking-wider"` |
| 5   | No className hacks on Mark as Sent button (pure variant-based styling) | ✓ VERIFIED | Only typography classes, no color overrides like `text-[#aaa]` |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected    | Status | Details |
| -------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| `src/components/ui/button.tsx` | Button component with unified ghost variant | ✓ VERIFIED | 49 lines, contains `ghost: 'border-white/20 hover:border-white/40 bg-white/[0.02] text-[#888] hover:text-white'` at line 17 |
| `src/components/features/climb-card.tsx` | ClimbCard with properly styled Mark as Sent button | ✓ VERIFIED | 221 lines, exports ClimbCard, uses `variant="ghost"` at line 211 with SelectionButton typography |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To  | Via | Status | Details |
| ---- | --- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| `src/components/features/climb-card.tsx` | `src/components/ui/button.tsx` | Button component ghost variant | ✓ WIRED | ClimbCard imports Button (line 5) and uses `variant="ghost"` (line 211) |

### Requirements Coverage

No specific requirements mapped to Phase 15.1 in REQUIREMENTS.md.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| N/A | N/A | None | - | No TODO/FIXME/placeholder patterns found |

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Visual styling verification

**Test:** Start dev server (`pnpm dev`), navigate to Dashboard, view a failed climb card
**Expected:** Mark as Sent button displays with:
- Background: subtle white/0.02 (minimal, not solid white)
- Border: white/20, transitions to white/40 on hover
- Text: #888 by default, transitions to white on hover
**Why human:** Visual appearance and hover transitions cannot be verified programmatically

#### 2. Design consistency check

**Test:** Compare Mark as Sent button to other secondary buttons (Settings button in nav, Back button in wizard)
**Expected:** All buttons use consistent white opacity pattern and typography
**Why human:** Visual consistency requires human perception of design harmony

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All must-haves verified. The ghost variant implementation matches the design system patterns from Phase 14, and the ClimbCard component uses it properly without any className hacks.
