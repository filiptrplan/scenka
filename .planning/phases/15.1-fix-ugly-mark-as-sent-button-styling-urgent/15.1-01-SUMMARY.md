# Phase 15.1 Plan 01: Fix Ugly Mark as Sent Button Styling Summary

**Button ghost variant with white opacity pattern matching Phase 14 design system**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 9 min (597s)
- **Started:** 2026-01-17T09:35:22Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-17T09:45:19Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Updated Button component ghost variant to use white opacity pattern (bg-white/[0.02], border-white/20, hover:border-white/40)
- Replaced className color hack (text-[#aaa]) with proper variant-based styling
- Added SelectionButton typography (text-xs font-black uppercase tracking-wider) for visual consistency
- Mark as Sent button now conforms to unified design system established in Phase 14

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update Button component to add unified ghost variant** - `13c71ee` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update ClimbCard to use ghost variant for Mark as Sent button** - `61f6f18` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** Not yet committed (will be in final commit with STATE.md update)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Updated ghost variant from shadcn/ui default to white opacity pattern
- `src/components/features/climb-card.tsx` - Changed Mark as Sent button from outline to ghost variant, removed className hack

## Decisions Made

- Extended existing Button component with custom ghost variant instead of creating separate GhostButton component - maintains single source of truth for button styling
- Used white opacity colors directly instead of CSS variables - matches design system patterns from Phase 14
- Applied SelectionButton typography to Mark as Sent button - ensures consistent visual hierarchy across action buttons

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - implementation was straightforward following established patterns.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

This phase is a standalone styling fix. No dependencies for future phases.

The Button component now provides a proper ghost variant that other components can use for secondary/minimal buttons, reducing the need for className hacks throughout the codebase.
