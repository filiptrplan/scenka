# Plan 01: Fix Mark as Sent Button Styling - SUMMARY

**Phase:** 10.1-fix-mark-as-sent-button-styling
**Plan:** 01
**Completed:** 2026-01-16
**Duration:** 3 minutes

## Objective

Fix white "Mark as Sent" button styling to conform with app's shadcn/ui design system. Remove custom Tailwind classes that override shadcn/ui Button's built-in outline variant styling, creating an inconsistent white appearance.

## Execution Summary

### Tasks Completed: 1/1

**Task 1: Remove custom Button classes from Mark as Sent button**
- **Status:** ✅ Complete
- **File:** `/home/filip/Repos/scenka/src/components/features/climb-card.tsx`
- **Commit:** `337ca02`

#### Changes Made

Removed custom className from the "Mark as Sent" Button component:

**Before:**
```tsx
<Button
  type="button"
  onClick={handleMarkAsSent}
  disabled={updateClimb.isPending}
  variant="outline"
  className="w-full border-emerald-500/50 hover:bg-emerald-500/10 text-emerald-400 hover:text-emerald-300"
>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Button
  type="button"
  onClick={handleMarkAsSent}
  disabled={updateClimb.isPending}
  variant="outline"
>
```

#### Rationale

The custom className was manually overriding shadcn/ui Button's outline variant styling, creating:
- White background (from border-emerald-500/50)
- Custom emerald color overrides that didn't match the app's design system
- Inconsistent appearance compared to other buttons in the app

By removing the custom className, the Button now uses shadcn/ui's built-in outline variant which:
- Properly inherits the app's design tokens
- Provides consistent hover states
- Uses the correct background color from the theme
- Follows shadcn/ui patterns used throughout the codebase

## Verification

- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors (`pnpm typecheck`)
- [x] Button styling now consistent with app's design system
- [x] No white background overrides
- [x] No changes to button behavior or functionality

## Outcome

The "Mark as Sent" button now properly uses shadcn/ui's outline variant without custom class overrides, conforming to the app's design system and eliminating the white appearance issue.

## Next Steps

Phase 10.1 is complete. Proceed to Phase 13: Revamp Analytics for More Insightful Graphs (next in roadmap).
