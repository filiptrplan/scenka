# Phase 11: Make a Nice README - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A quick landing page README that gives someone the gist of what Scenka is in under 30 seconds. When you land on the repo, you should immediately get: "Oh, this is a climbing tracker, built with React, vibe-coded by this person for their own use."

It should feel casual and fun - not like a corporate product page. Think "hey I built this cool thing, here's what it does" rather than "Introducing Scenka v1.1 Enterprise Edition."

The disclaimer about it being vibe-coded and for personal enjoyment should be prominent but not apologetic. It's a feature, not a bug.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Quick understanding** - Within 30 seconds, visitor knows what it is, what tech stack, how to try it
- **Disclaimer visibility** - The "vibe-coded / personal use only" message is clear and upfront
- **Screenshot placeholders** - Descriptive reminders to add images later, not broken image links

</essential>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Casual, fun tone throughout
- Quick intro paragraph followed by bullet points
- Tech stack as badges or simple list
- "How to run it locally" section (pnpm dev)
- Screenshot placeholders like:
  - `<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of logger form -->`
  - `![Screenshot: Analytics dashboard showing failure breakdown](./docs/screenshots/analytics.png)`
  - Clear notes on where to capture images from the app
