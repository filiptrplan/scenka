<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write comprehensive README.md with casual tone</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Create README.md with:
- Quick intro paragraph explaining "Oh, this is a climbing tracker, built with React, vibe-coded for personal use"
- Casual, fun tone throughout (not corporate)
- Bullet points for key features (exception logging, failure-focused, privacy-first, offline-first PWA)
- Tech stack as simple list or badges (React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase + shadcn/ui)
- "How to run it locally" section with pnpm dev instructions
- Quick reference to available scripts (dev, build, lint, typecheck, test)
- Prominent disclaimer section: "Vibe-coded for personal enjoyment - use if helpful, but no SLA!"

Structure suggestion:
1. Hero/header with quick intro
2. What makes Scenka different
3. Tech stack
4. Quick start / local setup
5. Screenshots section (placeholder for Task 2)
6. Development notes (optional: conventions, testing)
7. Disclaimer (prominent but not apologetic)</action>
  <verify>README.md exists and contains intro, features, tech stack, and setup sections</verify>
  <done>README.md is comprehensive with casual tone and all required sections present</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add screenshot placeholders with descriptive TODOs</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Add screenshot placeholders in a dedicated section with:
- Clear markdown image syntax with alt text descriptions
- TODO comments for each screenshot explaining what image to capture
- Suggested screenshot locations:
  1. Logger form (climb entry form with all fields)
  2. Analytics dashboard (charts showing failure breakdown)
  3. Settings page (hold color preferences, grade scale selection)
  4. Climb history view (list of logged climbs with details)
  5. Mobile view (showing PWA experience on phone)

Placeholder format:
```markdown
<!-- TODO: Capture screenshot from app -->
![Screenshot: [descriptive alt text]](./docs/screenshots/[filename].png)

*[Capture from: specific location/instruction]*
```

Use descriptive alt text for accessibility (e.g., "Screenshot: Logger form with grade picker, outcome selection, and multi-select style tags"). Don't create the actual docs/screenshots/ directory yet - these are reminders for you to add images later.</action>
  <verify>README.md contains Screenshots section with 5+ placeholder images using <!-- TODO: --> comments</verify>
  <done>All screenshot placeholders are descriptive with clear capture instructions</done>
</task>
