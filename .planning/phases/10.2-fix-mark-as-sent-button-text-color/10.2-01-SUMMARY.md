# Plan 10.2-01: Fix Mark as Sent Button Text Color

**Status:** Complete
**Executed:** 2026-01-16
**Duration:** ~3 min
**Commit:** 5c1a8a3

## Objective

Fix white text color on "Mark as Sent" button to match app's selection button pattern.

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Add light gray text color to Mark as Sent button

Added `text-[#aaa]` className to the "Mark as Sent" button to override shadcn/ui outline variant's default white text.

**Changes:**
- Modified `/home/filip/Repos/scenka/src/components/features/climb-card.tsx` (line 201)
- Added `className="text-[#aaa]"` to Button component
- Text now matches selection button pattern used throughout app:
  - Climbs/Analytics navigation buttons: `text-[#aaa]`
  - Boulder/Sport discipline toggles: `text-[#aaa]`

**Verification:**
- TypeScript typecheck passes with no errors
- Button maintains emerald color theming for border/hover states (via shadcn/ui outline variant)
- Light gray text provides better visual consistency across the app

## Outcomes

The "Mark as Sent" button now uses light gray text (`text-[#aaa]`) instead of default white, creating a more cohesive visual experience with other selection buttons in the app. This follows the established design pattern where selection and toggle buttons use light gray text rather than white, reducing visual jarring and maintaining a consistent aesthetic.

## Decisions Made

- Used `text-[#aaa]` custom Tailwind class to match existing selection button pattern
- Minimal change - only added className without altering button behavior or functionality
- Kept shadcn/ui outline variant for proper emerald color theming on border/hover states

## Files Modified

- `/home/filip/Repos/scenka/src/components/features/climb-card.tsx` - Added `text-[#aaa]` className to "Mark as Sent" button

## Next Steps

Phase 10.2 complete. Proceed to Phase 13 (Revamp Analytics for More Insightful Graphs) or Phase 14 (Unify UI Styles).
