# Phase 13: Revamp Analytics for More Insightful Graphs - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-16
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The analytics dashboard should be a training tool - not just data visualization. I want to glance at the charts and immediately know what to work on next.

The key insight is: this app is focused solely on improvement. Every chart should help identify weaknesses that inform training plans.

Main focus area is failure reason patterns - understanding why I'm failing so I can design targeted training. Not just "how many times did I fail" but "what's the root cause?" - finger strength, core, mental game, precision, etc.

Replace weak/useless charts (like the current Style Distribution) with more meaningful metrics that directly support training decisions.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clear training priorities** - The analytics must tell you "do this first" at a glance. Not just data dumps, but clear hierarchy: what's the most important thing to work on right now?
- **Actionable weakness identification** - Failure reasons need to become training recommendations, not just bar charts
- **Visual clarity over volume** - Better organized insights > more charts

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

No specific UI/UX requirements yet - open to standard approaches that deliver clear training priorities

The core is: when I look at analytics, I should know what to train next without digging through multiple charts.

## Additional Context

Current issues to address:
- Style Distribution graph is not useful for training decisions
- Not all bar names display (label overflow problem)
- Need more insightful graphs overall

The user wants to move beyond descriptive analytics ("here's what you did") to prescriptive analytics ("here's what you should do about it").
