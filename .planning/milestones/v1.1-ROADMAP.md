**Phases:** 5-17 (with decimal phases 5.1, 10.1, 10.2, 15.1)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

- Phase 5.1: Logger Window Close Setting (inserted after Phase 5 for user preference)
- Phase 10.1: Fix Mark as Sent Button Styling (inserted after Phase 10 for urgent styling fix)
- Phase 10.2: Fix Mark as Sent Button Text Color (inserted after Phase 10.1 for urgent styling fix)
- Phase 15.1: Fix ugly Mark as Sent button styling (inserted after Phase 15 for urgent styling fix)

**Key Decisions:**

- Used useImperativeHandle pattern instead of callback prop for cleaner parent-child communication (Phase 5)
- Default preference is true (close logger) - matches one-time entry pattern, user can opt-in to rapid entry (Phase 5.1)
- Edit climbs always close sheet regardless of preference - keeps existing behavior consistent (Phase 5.1)
- Used rose-500 theme color matching Anti-Style chart for visual consistency across failure-focused analytics (Phase 7)
- Purple-500 theme color for Style Distribution chart to visually distinguish from rose-500 failure charts (Phase 8)
- Used existing useUpdateClimb() hook for mutation - no custom mutation logic needed (Phase 9)
- Teal-500 theme color for redemption data to distinguish from other analytics (Phase 10)
- Extended Button component with custom ghost variant instead of creating separate GhostButton component (Phase 15.1)
- Used white opacity colors directly instead of CSS variables - matches design system patterns from Phase 14 (Phase 15.1)
- Applied SelectionButton typography to Mark as Sent button for consistent visual hierarchy (Phase 15.1)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Logger form required manual reset after each climb submission - solved with auto-reset functionality
- Analytics lacked actionable training insights - solved with Training Priorities chart positioned first
- Inconsistent UI styling across app - solved with SelectionButton, FormSection, FormLabel components
- "Mark as Sent" button didn't conform to app design - solved with ghost variant extension
- Toggle component was too large/jarring - solved with minimal Toggle component

**Issues Deferred:**

None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - all refactoring improved maintainability without shortcuts
